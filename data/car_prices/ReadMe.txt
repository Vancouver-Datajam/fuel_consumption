#  Data scraped from https://www.ccarprice.com/us/ on Sep 12th.
#  Collected from each brand name's page (on the right side) eg https://www.ccarprice.com/us/honda-car-prices-in-USA-1
#  Scraping was done manually by copying and pasting - this is the reason for the duplicate lines of car names on each line, the picture title. 
#  This data showed all models announced in 2023, not just 2023 model years, so anything not marked as 2023 was filtered out
#  The US in the title appears to only be the currency, so there are most definitely makes and models of vehicle not available in North America.
